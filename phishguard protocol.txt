Phishguard+
Got phished? Don't Worry! you got a guard Now!!!

THE PROTOCOL :-

We will have 3 tabs or pages you may say which would be as follows:-
1. Dashboard
2. Threats
3. Scanner

In the header we would have the Name Phishguard+ with the logo and a status that shows if the guard is online or not.It would also contain the Navbar with HOME, ABOUT, and CONTACT US.

Dashboard:-

The Dashboard section would contain some basic information about your system or browser (depends if we make a website a software or a extension). Mainly containing the Safety Score, Active 
Threats, Last Scanned, And the Recent Threats.

Threats:-

It would show the previous and the current threats. The area where we would see the threats we would get a status which shows the criticality of the threat (risk score of the website, is 
HTTPS there or not etc.)

Scanner:-

It would get a textbox in which when the user would enter a link and would give the input if the URL is safe or not.


We would have footer in every section and we will figure out what to put innit.
